# Resource recommendations

Recommend resources as the build reaches each moment, do not wait to be asked. When the work arrives at a palette, a font choice, an icon set, a hero image, a background, a chart, a mockup or a favicon, name the two to four best-fit sites, say what to grab, and offer to pull it in. Prefer these curated sites for production-quality assets. The bundled `assets/` library is a fallback, for when you need something instantly, offline or as a placeholder.

The full catalogue is `tools/design-system/data/resources.csv` (1,008 sites, 33 categories). Search it for more options:

```bash
python3 tools/design-system/scripts/search.py "<keyword>" --domain resources
```

Each row now carries a `tier` (top or more), a `cost` (free, freemium or paid), a `use` licence hint and a `status`. Lead with the top tier, name the cost when it is not free, read the `use` column before committing a file, and skip anything the maintenance check has marked dead. For the API-backed sources (icons via Iconify, fonts via Google Fonts, CC0 photos via Openverse and the museums, avatars via DiceBear), the build fetches the asset directly with [fetch-asset.md](fetch-asset.md); for the rest, recommend the site to open. Refresh liveness with:

> **Code is not an asset, and "recommend the site" is not the rule for it.** When the need is a component or an effect rather than a file, open the source and read it: this skill has `WebFetch`. What you may then do with what you read depends on where it came from, and [sourcing-external-code.md](sourcing-external-code.md) is the whole rule (install a registry and own the code; read a reference and re-author it). The `use` column states the regime per row.

```bash
node tools/design-system/scripts/check-resources.mjs
```

| Scaffold | A CSS framework or a template | Tailwind, Open Props, Bootstrap. Templates: HTML5 UP, Start Bootstrap, Cruip |

## By aesthetic

Match the source to the direction in DIRECTION.md, a brutalist concept does not call for the same fonts or illustrations as a soft, friendly one.

| Aesthetic | Type | Imagery | Color |
|-----------|------|---------|-------|
| Brutalist or raw | Monospace or a heavy grotesque | Stark photography, no soft illustration | High contrast, one loud color |
| Editorial | A serif display with a clean text face | Art-directed photography | Restrained, ink and one accent |
| Playful or friendly | A rounded sans (Fredoka, Quicksand) | unDraw, Open Peeps, Humaaans | Bright and warm |
| Minimal or Swiss | A neutral grotesque on a tight grid | Little imagery, strong whitespace | Mostly neutral, one accent |
| Luxury | A high-contrast Didone serif | Dark, spacious photography | Black with gold or a deep jewel tone |
| Retro | A pixel or bold display face | Halftones and stickers | Saturated primaries |
| Techy or product | A grotesque used with intent, mono for data | Abstract 3D, gradients used sparingly | Cool blues or a single vivid accent |

## Rules

Curated sites first, the bundled `assets/` library as a fallback for quick, offline or placeholder assets. Honor the license notes: for photos and video, follow [references/stock-media.md](stock-media.md) and never commit a use-only file. State the cost when a site is freemium or paid. A logo is a trademark, so suggest a real mark over a generic logo maker. Keep image assets optimized (WebP or AVIF) once fetched. To turn a pick into wired, self-hosted code, follow [resource-recipes.md](resource-recipes.md).
