Identify and improve unclear, confusing, or poorly written interface text to make the product easier to understand and use.

## Assess Current Copy

Identify what makes the text unclear or ineffective:

1. **Find clarity problems**:
   - **Jargon**: Technical terms users won't understand
   - **Ambiguity**: Multiple interpretations possible
   - **Passive voice**: "Your file has been uploaded" vs "We uploaded your file"
   - **Length**: Too wordy or too terse
   - **Assumptions**: Assuming user knowledge they don't have
   - **Missing context**: Users don't know what to do or why
   - **Tone mismatch**: Too formal, too casual, or inappropriate for situation

2. **Understand the context**:
   - Who's the audience? (Technical? General? First-time users?)
   - What's the user's mental state? (Stressed during error? Confident during success?)
   - What's the action? (What do we want users to do?)
   - What's the constraint? (Character limits? Space limitations?)

**CRITICAL**: Clear copy helps users succeed. Unclear copy creates frustration, errors, and support tickets.

## Plan Copy Improvements

Create a strategy for clearer communication:

- **Primary message**: What's the ONE thing users need to know?
- **Action needed**: What should users do next (if anything)?
- **Tone**: How should this feel? (Helpful? Apologetic? Encouraging?)
- **Constraints**: Length limits, brand voice, localization considerations

**IMPORTANT**: Good UX writing is invisible. Users should understand immediately without noticing the words.

## Improve Copy Systematically

Work in passes, one dimension at a time, and re-check the earlier passes after each one.
A single sweep that tries to fix clarity, proof and emotion at once fixes none of them:
tightening a sentence for clarity often removes the specific number that was carrying the
proof, which is exactly what the return pass is for.

| Pass | Question it asks | What it kills |
|------|------------------|---------------|
| 1. Clarity | Can a first-time reader say what this is, in their own words | Jargon, abstraction, sentences carrying two ideas |
| 2. Voice and tone | Does this sound like the same product throughout | Register drift, borrowed startup cadence |
| 3. So what | For each claim, ask "ok, and so what" until a benefit answers | Features stated with no consequence attached |
| 4. Prove it | What makes this believable to someone who does not trust us yet | Adjectives standing in for evidence |
| 5. Specificity | Replace every vague quantity with the real one | "Save time" where "save 4 hours a week" was available |
| 6. Emotion | Does the copy name the frustration the reader actually has | Neutral description of a painful situation |
| 7. Zero risk | What is the reader afraid of, and does the page answer it | Unanswered objections next to the buy button |

After each pass, return to the passes before it. The sequence matters: specificity added
in pass 5 frequently breaks the voice set in pass 2.

Passes 3, 4 and 7 have their own references. The claim and evidence work belongs to
[../../../agents/siteasy-agent-claims.md](../../../agents/siteasy-agent-claims.md), the
objection inventory to [objections.md](objections.md), and the risk reversal to
[offer-diagnostic.md](offer-diagnostic.md).



Refine text across these common areas:

### Error Messages
**Bad**: "Error 403: Forbidden"
**Good**: "You don't have permission to view this page. Contact your admin for access."

**Bad**: "Invalid input"
**Good**: "Email addresses need an @ symbol. Try: name@example.com"

**Principles**:
- Explain what went wrong in plain language
- Suggest how to fix it
- Don't blame the user
- Include examples when helpful
- Link to help/support if applicable

### Form Labels & Instructions
**Bad**: "DOB (MM/DD/YYYY)"
**Good**: "Date of birth" (with placeholder showing format)

**Bad**: "Enter value here"
**Good**: "Your email address" or "Company name"

**Principles**:
- Use clear, specific labels (not generic placeholders)
- Show format expectations with examples
- Explain why you're asking (when not obvious)
- Put instructions before the field, not after
- Keep required field indicators clear

### Button & CTA Text
**Bad**: "Click here" | "Submit" | "OK"
**Good**: "Create account" | "Save changes" | "Got it, thanks"

**Principles**:
- Describe the action specifically
- Use active voice (verb + noun)
- Match user's mental model
- Be specific ("Save" is better than "OK")

### Help Text & Tooltips
**Bad**: "This is the username field"
**Good**: "Choose a username. You can change this later in Settings."

**Principles**:
- Add value (don't just repeat the label)
- Answer the implicit question ("What is this?" or "Why do you need this?")
- Keep it brief but complete
- Link to detailed docs if needed

### Empty States
**Bad**: "No items"
**Good**: "No projects yet. Create your first project to get started."

**Principles**:
- Explain why it's empty (if not obvious)
- Show next action clearly
- Make it welcoming, not dead-end

### Success Messages
**Bad**: "Success"
**Good**: "Settings saved! Your changes will take effect immediately."

**Principles**:
- Confirm what happened
- Explain what happens next (if relevant)
- Be brief but complete
- Match the user's emotional moment (celebrate big wins)

### Loading States
**Bad**: "Loading..." (for 30+ seconds)
**Good**: "Analyzing your data... this usually takes 30-60 seconds"

**Principles**:
- Set expectations (how long?)
- Explain what's happening (when it's not obvious)
- Show progress when possible
- Offer escape hatch if appropriate ("Cancel")

### Confirmation Dialogs
**Bad**: "Are you sure?"
**Good**: "Delete 'Project Alpha'? This can't be undone."

**Principles**:
- State the specific action
- Explain consequences (especially for destructive actions)
- Use clear button labels ("Delete project" not "Yes")
- Don't overuse confirmations (only for risky actions)

### Navigation & Wayfinding
**Bad**: Generic labels like "Items" | "Things" | "Stuff"
**Good**: Specific labels like "Your projects" | "Team members" | "Settings"

**Principles**:
- Be specific and descriptive
- Use language users understand (not internal jargon)
- Make hierarchy clear
- Consider information scent (breadcrumbs, current location)

## Apply Clarity Principles

Every piece of copy should follow these rules:

1. **Be specific**: "Enter email" not "Enter value"
2. **Be concise**: Cut unnecessary words (but don't sacrifice clarity)
3. **Be active**: "Save changes" not "Changes will be saved"
4. **Be human**: "Oops, something went wrong" not "System error encountered"
5. **Be helpful**: Tell users what to do, not just what happened
6. **Be consistent**: Use same terms throughout (don't vary for variety)

**NEVER**:
- Use jargon without explanation
- Blame users ("You made an error" → "This field is required")
- Be vague ("Something went wrong" without explanation)
- Use passive voice unnecessarily
- Write overly long explanations (be concise)
- Use humor for errors (be empathetic instead)
- Assume technical knowledge
- Vary terminology (pick one term and stick with it)
- Repeat information (headers restating intros, redundant explanations)
- Use placeholders as the only labels (they disappear when users type)

## Verify Improvements

Test that copy improvements work:

- **Comprehension**: Can users understand without context?
- **Actionability**: Do users know what to do next?
- **Brevity**: Is it as short as possible while remaining clear?
- **Consistency**: Does it match terminology elsewhere?
- **Tone**: Is it appropriate for the situation?

Remember: You're a clarity expert with excellent communication skills. Write like you're explaining to a smart friend who's unfamiliar with the product. Be clear, be helpful, be human.

## UX copy patterns

Microcopy is interface. The same rules every time: clear, concise, consistent, useful, human.

### Error messages

Structure every error as what happened, why, and how to fix it: "Payment declined. Your bank rejected the charge. Try another card or contact your bank." Not "Error 402". Name the problem in the reader's terms, never the system's.

### Calls to action

Label the outcome, not the mechanism: "Start the trial", "Send the invite", "Delete account". Avoid "Submit", "OK" and "Click here". The label should make sense read alone.

### Empty states

An empty state is a first impression, not a dead end. Say what goes here, why it is empty, and the one action that fills it: "No projects yet. Create your first to get started." plus the button.

### Confirmations and destructive actions

Name the specific consequence and object: "Delete the Q3 report? This cannot be undone." The confirming button repeats the verb ("Delete"), never a generic "Yes".

### Tone

Write like a competent person, not a mascot and not a manual. Drop filler ("please note that", "in order to"). Match the moment: plain in errors, warmer in success, never jokey in a failure the reader did not cause.

## Spotting machine-written copy

The rhythm-level tells are below. The lexical tells, with a penalty per pattern and a
banded score, are in [slop-patterns.md](slop-patterns.md), and the deterministic
measurement of sentence rhythm and phrase density is
[../../../tools/content/score.mjs](../../../tools/content/score.mjs). This section is the
short read; that pair is the scored version.


Generated copy has tells. When auditing or editing site text, watch for and remove these:

- Uniform sentence rhythm, every sentence the same length. Break it with a short one.
- Repetitive openings, many sentences starting with the same word ("Moreover", "Additionally"). Vary the first word.
- Overused connectors ("moreover", "furthermore", "in addition", "as such") on most sentences. Cut the mechanical ones, keep the load-bearing ones.
- The rule of three on autopilot, where every list is three items. Vary it to one, two or four.
- Contrastive amplification, "not only X but also Y". Replace with a direct statement.
- A two-word phrase repeated several times on one page. Reword the reprises.

These are form, not fact. Fix the wording, never the meaning, and re-read aloud: copy that sounds like a person passes.
