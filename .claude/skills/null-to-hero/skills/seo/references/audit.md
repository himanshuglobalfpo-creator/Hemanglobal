# Full Website SEO Audit

## Process

1. **Fetch homepage** via WebFetch or Bash
2. **Detect business type** — analyze homepage signals
3. **Crawl site** — follow internal links up to 500 pages, respect robots.txt
4. **Dispatch the five specialist sub-agents in parallel** (see "Parallel audit architecture" below)
5. **Score** — aggregate each dimension into the SEO Health Score (0–100) using the weights below
6. **Report** — generate prioritized action plan

## Parallel audit architecture

The audit runs five specialist sub-agents concurrently, each scoped to one dimension. Launch them with the Task tool in a single message (one `Task` call per agent, all in the same turn) so they execute in parallel rather than one after another. Pass each agent the target URL plus any page HTML already fetched.

| Sub-agent (`subagent_type`) | Dimension | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| `seo-agent-technical` | Technical | crawlability, indexability, HTTPS, robots.txt, sitemaps, mobile, JS rendering, security headers |
| `seo-agent-content` | Content + On-Page | E-E-A-T, titles, meta, headings, readability, thin content, AI citation readiness |
| `seo-agent-schema` | Schema | JSON-LD detection, validation, rich result eligibility |
| `seo-agent-performance` | Performance + Images | speed signals, image optimization, fonts, render-blocking, CWV readiness |
| `seo-agent-geo` | AI search | AI crawler access, llms.txt, passage citability, brand authority |

Each agent returns its dimension score and findings. Wait for all five to complete, then aggregate. If the Task tool or plugin agents are unavailable in the current harness, fall back to running the five dimension checklists inline, in sequence, using the same scoring weights. Never skip a dimension silently.

The seven scored dimensions below map onto these five agents: images fold into performance, on-page into content and sitemap checks into technical. `/audit` dispatches the same five agents but re-aggregates them with its own five weights, so its SEO sub-score is intentionally not the seven-dimension score computed here.

Title tags, meta descriptions, heading structure, internal linking

### Schema & Structured Data
Current implementation, validation errors, missing opportunities

### Performance
LCP, INP, CLS scores, resource optimization

### Images
Missing alt text, oversized images, format recommendations

### AI Search Readiness
Citability score, structural improvements, authority signals

## Priority Definitions

- **Critical** — Blocks indexing or causes penalties (fix immediately)
- **High** — Significantly impacts rankings (fix within 1 week)
- **Medium** — Optimization opportunity (fix within 1 month)
- **Low** — Nice to have (backlog)

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| URL unreachable | Report the error. Do not guess site content. Suggest verifying the URL. |
| robots.txt blocks crawling | Analyze only accessible pages, note the limitation. |
| Rate limiting (429) | Back off, reduce requests, report partial results. |
| Timeout on large sites | Cap at timeout, report findings for pages crawled. |
